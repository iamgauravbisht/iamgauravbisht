## 🧭 About Me

I'm a passionate developer from New Delhi, currently working as an **Assistant System Engineer at TCS**.  
Over the last 60 days, I’ve been on a mission — to transform myself into a **Software Development Engineer (SDE)** ready for Amazon and top-tier product companies.

From brushing up DSA to polishing real-world projects and mastering system design fundamentals, this profile is a reflection of that **grind, growth, and grit**.

- ⚙️ **System Design Basics** (Load Balancing, Caching, DB Sharding)
- ☁️ **Cloud & Deployment** (AWS, Render, Vercel)
- 📦 **Clean Code, Git, Testing, and CI/CD**

## 🔥 Highlights of My Journey

✅ Completed **Blind 75** and solved 150+ LeetCode questions  
✅ Rebuilt and deployed 3 full-stack apps with better UI/UX & auth  
✅ Documented system design of my own projects
